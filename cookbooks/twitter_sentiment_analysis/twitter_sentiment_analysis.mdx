# Build an agent for sentiment analysis of brand mentions

Learn how to use Exfunc and OpenAI to analyze sentiment around mentions of a particular brand or product.

## Setup

Install our python dependencies, including openai and exfunc.

```bash
pip install exfunc openai
```

## Getting your OpenAI and Exfunc API Keys

To use OpenAI GPT-4o and Exfunc, you will need to get your API keys. You can get your OpenAI API key from [here](https://www.openai.com/) and your Exfunc API key from [here](https://exfunc.com).

## Search tweets with Exfunc

To be able to search tweets, we will use [Exfunc](https://exfunc.com). Exfunc provides an easy-to-use endpoint for searching tweets.

Here is how we will search tweets using exfunc:

```python
from exfunc import Exfunc

s = Exfunc(api_key="YOUR-KEY")

search_tweets_result = s.twitter.search_tweets(request={
    "query": "YourBrand", # Replace with your target brand name
    "type": "latest"
})

print(search_tweets_result)
```

## Sentiment Analysis

Now that we have the tweets data, let's run through the results with sentiment analysis.

```python
from openai import OpenAI
import csv
import datetime

# OpenAI API credentials
OPENAI_API_KEY = 'your_openai_api_key'
openai_client = OpenAI(
    api_key=OPENAI_API_KEY
)

# Function to analyze sentiment using GPT-4o
def analyze_sentiment(tweet_text):
    # OpenAI prompt for sentiment analysis
    prompt = f"Please determine the sentiment of the following tweet as 'Positive', 'Negative', or 'Neutral': \"{tweet_text}\""

    # OpenAI API call
    response = openai_client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4o",
        messages=[
            {"role": "system", "content": "You are an assistant that classifies the sentiment of tweets."},
            {"role": "user", "content": prompt}
        ],
        max_tokens=10,
        temperature=0  # Lower temperature for consistent output
    )

    # Extract sentiment from response
    sentiment = response.choices[0].message.content.strip()
    return sentiment

# Search and analyze brand mentions
def search_and_analyze_brand_mentions(brand_name):
    # Open CSV file to save results
    with open(f"{brand_name}_sentiment_analysis.csv", mode="w") as csv_file:
        writer = csv.writer(csv_file)
        writer.writerow(["Timestamp", "Tweet", "Sentiment"])

        # Search for recent tweets mentioning the brand
        for tweet in search_tweets_result.tweets:
            tweet_text = tweet.full_text
            timestamp = tweet.created_at
            sentiment = analyze_sentiment(tweet_text)

            # Write results to CSV
            writer.writerow([timestamp, tweet_text, sentiment])
            print(f"Tweet: {tweet_text}\nSentiment: {sentiment}\n")

    print(f"Analysis complete! Results saved to {brand_name}_sentiment_analysis.csv")

# Run the function for a specific brand
brand_name = "YourBrand"  # Replace with your target brand name
search_and_analyze_brand_mentions(brand_name)
```

## Conclusion

You have now built an agent that looks at tweets and analyzes sentiments for any brand.
