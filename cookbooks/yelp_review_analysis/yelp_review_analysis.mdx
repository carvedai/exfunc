# Build a Yelp review analysis agent

Learn how to use Exfunc and OpenAI to analyze reviews on any business on Yelp.

## Setup

Install our python dependencies, including openai and exfunc.

```bash
pip install exfunc openai
```

## Getting your OpenAI and Exfunc API Keys

To use OpenAI GPT-4o and Exfunc, you will need to get your API keys. You can get your OpenAI API key from [here](https://www.openai.com/) and your Exfunc API key from [here](https://exfunc.com).

## Search businesses with Exfunc

To be able to search Yelp businesses, we will use [Exfunc](https://exfunc.com). Exfunc provides an easy-to-use endpoint for searching businesses.

Here is how we will search businesses using exfunc:

```python
from exfunc import Exfunc

s = Exfunc(api_key="YOUR-KEY")

search_businesses_result = s.yelp.search_businesses(request={
    "query": "wonton noodle soup", # replace with any search query of your choice
    "location": "San Francisco"
})

print(search_businesses_result)
```

## Get reviews of a business

Now that we have the businesses data, choose one of the businesses and fetch reviews:

```python
business_id = search_businesses_result.businesses[0].business_id

get_business_reviews_result = s.yelp.get_business_reviews(request={
    "business_id": business_id,
})

print(get_business_reviews_result)
```

## Generate a review analysis report

With the reviews data, let's generate an analysis report:

```python
from openai import OpenAI

# OpenAI API credentials
OPENAI_API_KEY = 'your_openai_api_key'
openai_client = OpenAI(
    api_key=OPENAI_API_KEY
)

# Function to analyze sentiment using GPT-4o
def generate_report(reviews_data):
    # OpenAI prompt for generating report
    prompt = f"Please generate a report of sentiment analysis and other key information from these yelp reviews about a business.\n\nReviews data: {reviews_data}"

    # OpenAI API call
    response = openai_client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4o",
        messages=[
            {"role": "system", "content": "You are an expert in generating reports on user contents, reviews, and businesses."},
            {"role": "user", "content": prompt}
        ],
        max_tokens=1000,
        temperature=0
    )

    report = response.choices[0].message.content.strip()
    return report

# Run the function to generate a report from reviews
reviews_data = get_business_reviews_result.reviews
report = generate_report(reviews_data)
print(report)
```

## Conclusion

You have now built an agent that can generate a comprehensive review analysis report.
