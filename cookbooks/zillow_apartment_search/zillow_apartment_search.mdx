# Build an agent for apartment search

Learn how to use Exfunc and OpenAI to search for 1-bedroom apartments in downtown Seattle.

## Setup

Install our python dependencies, including openai and exfunc.

```bash
pip install exfunc openai
```

## Getting your OpenAI and Exfunc API Keys

To use OpenAI gpt-4o-mini and Exfunc, you will need to get your API keys. You can get your OpenAI API key from [here](https://www.openai.com/) and your Exfunc API key from [here](https://exfunc.com).

## Search apartments with Exfunc

To search apartments, we will use [Exfunc](https://exfunc.com). Exfunc provides an easy-to-use endpoint for searching Zillow.

Here is how we will search Zillow using exfunc:

```python
from exfunc import Exfunc

s = Exfunc(api_key="YOUR-KEY")

search_properties_result = s.zillow.search_properties(request={
    "location": "Seattle",
    "listing_status": "for_rent",
    "min_num_bedrooms": "1",
    "max_num_bedrooms": "1",
})
properties = search_properties_result.properties
print(properties)
```

## Generate recommendations given search criteria

Now that we have property data, let's generate recommendations based on a search criteria.

```python
import json
from openai import OpenAI

# OpenAI API credentials
OPENAI_API_KEY = 'your_openai_api_key'
openai_client = OpenAI(
    api_key=OPENAI_API_KEY
)

# Function to generate recommendations using gpt-4o-mini
def generate_recs(search_criteria, properties):
    # OpenAI prompt for generating recommendations
    properties_str = "\n\n".join([json.dumps({k: v for k, v in p.dict().items() if k != "photos"}) for p in properties])
    prompt = f"Generate top recommendations of properties based on the search criteria.\n\nSearch criteria: {search_criteria}\n\nProperties: {properties_str}"
    # Make sure the prompt fits into the token limit
    prompt = prompt[:100000]

    # OpenAI API call
    response = openai_client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4o-mini",
        messages=[
            {"role": "user", "content": prompt}
        ],
        max_tokens=4000,
        temperature=0
    )
    return response.choices[0].message.content.strip()

# Run the function to generate recommendations
search_criteria = "priced under 2000, near downtown area"
recs = generate_recs(search_criteria, properties)
print(recs)
```

## Conclusion
