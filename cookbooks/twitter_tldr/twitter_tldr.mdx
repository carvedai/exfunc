# Generate a TLDR of tweets in real-time

Learn how to use Exfunc and OpenAI to generate a TLDR of tweets in real-time.

## Setup

Install our python dependencies, including openai and exfunc.

```bash
pip install exfunc openai
```

## Getting your OpenAI and Exfunc API Keys

To use OpenAI GPT-4o-mini and Exfunc, you will need to get your API keys. You can get your OpenAI API key from [here](https://www.openai.com/) and your Exfunc API key from [here](https://exfunc.com).

## Search tweets with Exfunc

To be able to search tweets, we will use [Exfunc](https://exfunc.com). Exfunc provides an easy-to-use endpoint for searching tweets.

Here is how we will search tweets using exfunc:

```python
import os
from exfunc import Exfunc

exfunc = Exfunc(api_key=os.getenv("EXFUNC_API_KEY"))

search_tweets_result = exfunc.twitter.search_tweets(request={
    "query": "mike tyson vs jake paul",  # replace with your topic of interest
    "type": "latest",
    "count": 20
})

print(search_tweets_result)
```

## TLDR

Now that we have the tweets data, let's generate a TLDR.

```python
from openai import OpenAI

openai = OpenAI()
response = openai.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o-mini",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "TLDR in bullet points."},
        {"role": "user", "content": search_tweets_result.json()}
    ],
    temperature=0
)

print(response.choices[0].message.content.strip())
```

## Conclusion

You have now implemented a script to generate a TLDR of tweets in real-time.
