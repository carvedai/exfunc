# Find VP / head of engineering at recently funded, mid-sized tech companies in US

Learn how to use Exfunc and OpenAI to find decision makers on LinkedIn.

## Getting Started

### Install packages

```bash
pip install exfunc openai
```

### Configure API keys

You will need to provide API keys. You can get your Exfunc API key [here](https://exfunc.com) and your OpenAI API key [here](https://www.openai.com/).

Ensure both API keys are accessible in your local environment.

```bash
export EXFUNC_API_KEY=...
export OPENAI_API_KEY=...
```

### Configure clients

```python
from exfunc import Exfunc
from openai import OpenAI

exfunc = Exfunc()
openai = OpenAI()
```

## Finding recently funded, mid-sized tech companies in US

### Search mid-sized tech companies in US

```python
num_pages = 1
company_linkedin_urls = []
for i in range(num_pages):
    search_results = exfunc.linkedin.search_companies(request={
        "locations": ["United States"],
        "sizes": ["11-50", "51-200", "201-500"],
            "industries": [
            "computer & network security",
            "computer games",
            "computer hardware",
            "computer networking",
            "computer software",
            "e-learning",
            "information services",
            "information technology & services",
            "internet",
            "semiconductors",
            "telecommunications",
            "wireless"
        ],
        "page": i+1,
    })
    company_linkedin_urls += [company.url for company in search_results.companies]

# dedup in case there are duplicate URLs
company_linkedin_urls = list(set(company_linkedin_urls))
```

### Get company funding information

We will get funding information by calling LinkedIn GetCompany API for each company.

```python
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor

def get_company(company_url):
    try:
        response = exfunc.linkedin.get_company(request={"company_url": company_url})
        return response.company
    except:
        return None

companies = []
with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=min(10, len(company_linkedin_urls))) as executor:
    for company in executor.map(get_company, company_linkedin_urls):
        if company:
            companies.append(company)
```

### Filter recently funded companies

```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

def has_recent_funding_round(funding_details):
    num_days = 180  # 6 months
    date_posted = funding_details.last_round.date_posted
    if not date_posted:
        return False

    last_round_date = datetime.strptime(date_posted, "%Y-%m-%d")
    cutoff_date = datetime.now() - timedelta(days=num_days)
    return last_round_date >= cutoff_date

recently_funded_companies = []
for company in companies:
    recently_funded = has_recent_funding_round(company.funding)
    if recently_funded:
        recently_funded_companies.append(company)
```

## Finding VP / head of engineering people

### Search decision makers

```python
decision_makers = {}
for company in recently_funded_companies:
    search_results = exfunc.linkedin.search_people(request={
        "company_domains": [company.website_url],
        "seniorities": ["vp", "head", "director"],
    })
    if search_results.people:
        decision_makers[company.url] = search_results.people
```

### Filter engineering people

```python
def qualify_job_title(job_title):
    target_description = "decision maker in engineering"
    prompt = f'Answer True or False: Does "{job_title}" match the description: "{target_description}"?\n'
    messages = [{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]
    response = openai.chat.completions.create(messages=messages, temperature=0, model="gpt-4o-mini")
    completion = response.choices[0].message.content.strip()
    return "true" in completion.lower()

for company_linkedin_url in decision_makers:
    people = decision_makers[company_linkedin_url]
    filtered_people = [person for person in people if qualify_job_title(person.title)]
    decision_makers[company_linkedin_url] = filtered_people
```

### View results

```python
import pandas as pd

result = []
for people in decision_makers.values():
    result += [person.model_dump() for person in people]

df = pd.DataFrame.from_records(result)
print(df.to_markdown(index=False))
