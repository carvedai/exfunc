# Build a news summarizer

Learn how to use Exfunc and OpenAI to summarize news from Google.

## Setup

Install our python dependencies, including openai and exfunc.

```bash
pip install exfunc openai
```

## Getting your OpenAI and Exfunc API Keys

To use OpenAI GPT-4o and Exfunc, you will need to get your API keys. You can get your OpenAI API key from [here](https://www.openai.com/) and your Exfunc API key from [here](https://exfunc.com).

## Search news with Exfunc

To be able to search news on Google, we will use [Exfunc](https://exfunc.com). Exfunc provides an easy-to-use endpoint for searching news.

Here is how we will search news using exfunc:

```python
from exfunc import Exfunc

s = Exfunc(api_key="YOUR-KEY")

search_news_result = s.google.search_news(request={
    "query": "election results analysis", # replace with any search query of your choice
    "time_published": "1d"
})

print(search_news_result)
```

## Get news article details

Now that we have the news data, scrape all pages and keep the markdowns:

```python
article_markdowns = []
for item in search_news_result.news:
    try:
        scrape_resp = s.navigator.scrape(request={
            "url": item.link
        })
        article_markdowns.append(scrape_resp.markdown)
    except Exception as e:
        print(e)
```

## Generate a summary report

With the news article details, let's generate a summary report:

```python
from openai import OpenAI

# OpenAI API credentials
OPENAI_API_KEY = 'your_openai_api_key'
openai_client = OpenAI(
    api_key=OPENAI_API_KEY
)

# Function to summarize news articles using GPT-4o
def generate_report(news_articles):
    # OpenAI prompt for generating report
    prompt = f"Please generate a summary report of provided news articles.\n\nArticles data: {news_articles}"
    # Make sure the prompt fits into the token limit
    prompt = prompt[:100000]

    # OpenAI API call
    response = openai_client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4o",
        messages=[
            {"role": "system", "content": "You are an expert in generating summary reports on news articles."},
            {"role": "user", "content": prompt}
        ],
        max_tokens=1000,
        temperature=0
    )

    report = response.choices[0].message.content.strip()
    return report

# Run the function to generate a summary report
report = generate_report(article_markdowns)
print(report)
```
